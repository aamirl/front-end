    <p>
    <st USE THE SELLYX SERVICE.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>These Terms apply to your access to and use of the Sellyx Service provided by Sellyx, Inc. (“Sellyx,” “we” and “us”). Additional terms (including, but not limited to, the terms of social media services and third-party payment processors) may apply to particular functionalities and features related to the Sellyx Service.</p>
    <h4>1. Eligibility</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>ONLY USERS WHO ARE THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER MAY REGISTER FOR OR USE THE SELLYX SERVICE.</strong>
        The Sellyx Service is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). If you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), you may use the Sellyx Service only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms and any applicable additional terms. You further represent and warrant that you: (a) have not previously been suspended or removed from using the Sellyx Service; (b) are legally permitted to, and do, live in the United States or one of its territories, and (c) may enter into this agreement without violating any other agreement to which you are a party. If you are registering to use the Sellyx Service on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that (i) such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and (ii) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Account Registration and Security Responsibilities</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>A. Process.</strong>
        In order to access certain parts of the Sellyx Service, you may be required to create a Sellyx account (an “Account”) or a seller payment account (“Stripe Account”) with Stripe, Inc. (“Stripe”). In connection with creating an Account or a Stripe Account, you must provide certain information (“Registration Data”) and answer all questions or fields marked “required.” You agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete Registration Data; (ii) maintain and update such Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete; and (iii) consent to allow Sellyx to contact you for the purpose of confirming some or all of your Registration Data, to conduct research and to resolve disputes, as Sellyx may elect to do from time to time.
    </p>
    <div><strong>B. Payment Options.</strong></div>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Cash and Other Payments Determined by Users.</strong>
        A buyer may, by agreement with the seller, elect to make payment by cash, check or other payment method accepted by the seller.
        Such payments are made directly between the buyer and the seller when they meet in person to complete their purchase and sale transaction, pursuant to terms they determine.
        Sellyx is not a party to such transactions, and does not facilitate such transactions, refunds or returns in any manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. SellyxPay.</strong>
        A buyer and seller may instead pay with and accept credit cards and other electronic payment methods (each an “Electronic Payment Method”) through the Sellyx Service.
        Sellyx has integrated with Stripe, a payment processing service, to allow sellers to accept certain Electronic Payment Methods from buyers using Stripe’s payment processing services (“SellyxPay”).
        Buyers who wish to use SellyxPay must register an Electronic Payment Method with Sellyx, and sellers must enroll for the service through SellyxPay.
        Sellyx, in its sole discretion, may from time to time impose limits on your ability to make and/or receive payments through SellyxPay. Additionally, Stripe may impose its own limits and limitations on a seller’s use of SellyxPay.
        For instance, a seller’s enrollment in SellyxPay is subject to Stripe’s confirmation that the seller meets Stripe’s enrollment criteria.  Sellers should refer to Section 2(d) below for information about the impact of failing to meet Stripe’s enrollment criteria.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>b. Sellers.</strong> By using SellyxPay to accept Electronic Payment Methods, you are entering into an agreement with Stripe subject to the terms of the <a class="alt" href="https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the <a class="alt" href="https://stripe.com/terms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stripe Terms of Service</a> (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”).
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Stripe Services Agreement, you will not have the right to have Stripe, and will not request that Stripe, transfer any buyer data Stripe collects via SellyxPay to an alternative payment processor.  Except for the foregoing restriction that supersedes any rights you may have in the Stripe Services Agreement, the Stripe Services Agreement is separate from these Terms.
        Sellyx is not a party to the Stripe Services Agreement and will not be liable or responsible for the payment services provided by Stripe.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>c. Seller Fees.</strong>
        You agree to pay the service fees (“Service Fees”) <!-- described in the <a class="alt" href="https://accounts.sellyx.com/sellerfinancialagreement" target="_self">FAQs</a> -->for the sales transactions you make using SellyxPay.
        The Service Fees include Electronic Payment Method processing fees of 3% to Stripe and 3.8% service fee to Sellyx when withdrawing money to your personal bank account. Sellyx reserves the right to change the Service Fees from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>d. Receiving Sales Proceeds.</strong> Upon completion of a sale in which the buyer uses SellyxPay, if you have not previously set up a personal bank account, then you must set up a bank account in accordance with the requirements specified by Sellyx to receive the payment via SellyxPay.  STRIPE MUST ACCEPT YOUR APPLICATION TO USE THE SELLYX PAYMENT SOLUTION BEFORE YOU CAN RECEIVE SALES PROCEEDS VIA THE SELLYX PAYMENT SOLUTION.  IF STRIPE REJECTS YOUR APPLICATION OR YOU FAIL TO SET UP A STRIPE ACCOUNT WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER COMPLETION OF A SALE PROCESSED BY STRIPE THROUGH THE SELLYX PAYMENT SOLUTION, THEN STRIPE MAY DISABLE OR LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SALES PROCEEDS VIA THE SELLYX PAYMENT SOLUTION.
    </p>
<!--     <p>
        <strong>e. Additional Information.</strong>
        For additional information regarding SellyxPay, see our <a class="alt" href="https://accounts.sellyx.com/aboutFinancials" target="_self">FAQs</a>.
    </p> -->
    <h4>3. Transactions Final</h4>
    <p>
         Regardless of the payment method chosen, ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL, AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS, UNLESS YOU AND THE SELLER OTHERWISE AGREE AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A REFUND. Sellyx will not be responsible for facilitating refunds.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Taxes.</h4>
    <p>
        It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to each transaction you complete via the Sellyx Service, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes.
        It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Sellyx is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or similar tax arising from any transaction you complete via the Sellyx Service.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Discontinuance of the Sellyx Service</h4>

    <h4>20. Arbitration</h4>
    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING A JURY TRIAL WAIVER) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH SELLYX AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SELLYX (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS).</p>
    <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
            <strong>A. Binding Arbitration.</strong>
            Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Sellyx agree (1) to waive your and Sellyx’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, the Sellyx Service or the Materials, resolved in a court, and (2) to waive your and Sellyx’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Sellyx agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>B. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.</strong>
            You and Sellyx agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sellyx Service or the Materials is personal to you and Sellyx and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
            You and Sellyx agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Sellyx agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>C. Federal Arbitration Act.</strong>
            You and Sellyx agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 20 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>D. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
            You and Sellyx agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Sellyx shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Sellyx, Inc., Attn: Sellyx Designated Agent, 401 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, California 90401. Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Sellyx Account, and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (2) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. Pursuant to Section 4, our notice to you will be sent to the email address you used to register for your Sellyx Account, and will include (a) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that we are seeking.
            If you and Sellyx cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Sellyx may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 20, commence an arbitration proceeding, or to the extent specifically provided for in section 20(A), file a claim in court.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>E. Process.</strong>
            Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Sellyx agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Sellyx within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Sellyx will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute).
            You and Sellyx agree that (1) any arbitration will occur in Los Angeles County, California, (2) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (3) that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>F. Authority of the Arbitrator.</strong>
            As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
            The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>G. Rules of JAMS.</strong>
            The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" class="alt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JAMS website</a>. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (1) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (2) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>H. Severability.</strong>
            If any term, clause or provision of this Section 20 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 20 will remain valid and enforceable.
            Further, the waivers set forth in Section 20(B) are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I. Opt-Out Right.</strong>
            You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 20 by writing to: Sellyx, Inc., Attn: Sellyx Designated Agent, 401 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, California 90401.
            In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 21.
